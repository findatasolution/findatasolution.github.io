<h1>Hyperparameter tunning</h2>

<p>Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best set of parameters for a machine learning model. It is a crucial step in the machine learning workflow, as it can significantly impact the model's performance.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

<h3>What are hyperparameters?</h3>

<p>Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data. They are set before the training process and are used to control the learning process.</p>
<p>This paper is about hyperparameter of XGBoost. 
  XGBoost is a popular machine learning algorithm that is known for its high performance and accuracy. It is a gradient boosting algorithm that uses decision trees as the base learners.</p>
