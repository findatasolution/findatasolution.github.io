<h1>FEATURE ENGINEERING</h1>

<p>Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<h2>Useful Techniques</h2>

<h2>Feature Engineering for Numerical Data</h2>

<h3>1. Feature Creation - Longlist</h3> 
<p>Feature creation is the process of creating new features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<h3>2. Feature Selection - Shortlist</h3>
<p>Feature selection is the process of selecting the most important features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>
<p>PSI, Information Gain, Missing Value Ratio, Correlation</p>
<h4>PSI</h4>
<p>PSI - Population Stability Index</p>
<p> PSI tell us the stability of a feature. </p>
<p> Common thresholds are:
    - PSI < = 0.1, feature is stable
    - 0.1 > PSI > 0.25, feature is slightly unstable
    - PSI > 0.25, feature is unstable</p>

<h4>Information Gain</h4>

<h4>Correlation</h4>
<p>Correlation is a measure of the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>Common thresholds are:
    - Correlation < 0.3, feature is not correlated
    - 0.3 > Correlation > 0.7, feature is moderately correlated
    - Correlation > 0.7, feature is highly correlated</p>
