<h1>FEATURE ENGINEERING</h1>

<p>Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<h2>Useful Techniques</h2>

<h2>Feature Engineering for Numerical Data</h2>

<h3>1. Feature Creation</h3> 
<p>Feature creation is the process of creating new features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<h3>2. Feature Selection</h3>
<p>Feature selection is the process of selecting the most important features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>
<p>PSI, Gini, Information Gain, Chi-Square, Missing Value Ratio, Correlation, PCA</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h3>3. Feature Extraction</h3>
<p>Feature extraction is the process of extracting features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<h3>4. Feature Transformation</h3>
<p>Feature transformation is the process of transforming features from a dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>
