<h1>RFM Model</h2>
  <p>RFM is a model that is used to segment customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.</p>
  <p>- Recency: The time since the customer's last purchase</p>
  <p>- Frequency: The number of purchases the customer has made</p>
  <p>- Monetary Value: The total amount of money the customer has spent</p>

  <h2>1. How to use RFM Model</h2>
    <p>- Calculate the recency, frequency, and monetary value for each customer</p>
    <p>- Segment the customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value</p>
    <p>- Use the segments to target the customers</p>

    <h3>Recency</h3>
    <p>Recency is the time since the customer's last purchase. It is a measure of how recently the customer has made a purchase.</p>
    <p>Recency is calculated by subtracting the date of the customer's last purchase from the current date.</p>
    <h3>Frequency</h3>
    <p>Frequency is the number of purchases the customer has made. It is a measure of how often the customer makes a purchase.</p>  
    <h3>Monetary Value</h3>
    <p>Monetary Value is the total amount of money the customer has spent. It is a measure of how much the customer has spent.</p>    

  <h2>2. Segmentation</h2>
    <p>Segmentation is the process of dividing the customers into different groups based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value.</p>

  <h2>3. Targeting</h2>
  <p>Targeting is the process of using the segments to target the customers.</p>  
  
  <h2>4. Study case</h2>
  <p>Your company is a lending company and you going to creata a metrix of pricing the loan for each customer segment 
    knowing that the minimum is COF at 5% and maximun is 45% following regulation. 
    You have a dataset of customer purchases. You can use the RFM model to segment the customers into different groups based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.</p>
